# Unfortunately, devenv doesn't expose any obvious way to expose scripts from
# inside the environment to the outside world. Using 'devenv shell' and specifying
# a subcommand or getting clever with environment variables gets us pretty close,
# but there's still a whole bunch of noise printed to the console. So, here's
# a script that gets around that problem by carefully using file descriptors to
# get only the output we care about.
#
# NOTE:
#   This script requires the devenv in question to handle the $DEVENV_SHELL_CMD
#   and $DEVENV_SHELL_CD environment variables if present when entering the devenv
#   shell by executing $DEVENV_SHELL_CMD in the working directory represented by
#   $DEVENV_SHELL_CD in favour of starting the usual shell session. It'd likely be
#   possible to avoid this requirement via subcommands to 'devenv shell'; we just
#   haven't bothered trying.
