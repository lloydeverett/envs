## Usage

Make sure [devenv](https://devenv.sh/getting-started/) is installed. Then you can hop into a shell via e.g.

```bash
cd home
devenv shell
```

## Environments

 - `home` - shell and editor environment focused on xonsh and vim
 - `vim-home` - like `home`, but using vim as a terminal session manager / multiplexer
 - `podman-example` - an experiment in running rootless and daemonless containers inside a devenv (see associated README, there are some prerequisites for the host OS)
